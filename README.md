# Code of Conduct Markdown Files

This repository provides markdown versions of Microsoft's Open Source Code of Conduct, and related documents for the purpose of feedback (issues, PRS).  The live/published 
version lives
at opensource.microsoft.com.   

## Proposed Updates
We have two proposed updates.

### 1. Code of Conduct Update

[This proposed version](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is based on version 2.0 of the Contributor's Covenant, but omits the 'Enforcement Guidelines'
section reflective of guidance in the Contributor's Covenant: "If the suggested actions and consequences donâ€™t suit the context of your community, consider moving this section 
to another document". That document for Microsoft is our FAQ.

### 2. FAQ
[This is a proposed update](FAQ.md) to the FAQ and reflect updates in the code of conduct itself.
