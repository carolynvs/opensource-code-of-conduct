# Contributing

We welcome your feedback on current or proposed versions of our Open Source Code of Conduct.  
Please review and adhere our current [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as a pre-requisite to participation.

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.
